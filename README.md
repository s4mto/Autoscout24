# AutoScout24 EDA_Fenyx_IT

## What is this project?

- In this project, we were given a dirty dataset of an online site called AutoScout24, which is used to buy and sell new and used vehicles, motorcycles and accessories, with 50 features belonging to 20 car brands from a certain range.
- Our aim here was to make the dataset given to us ready for Machine Learning. In this direction, the features were distributed to our group consisting of 4 people, with equal difficulty levels.

## How was this project done and what tools were used?

- We completed this project with my other 3 teammates in a period of 20 days.
- We applied Agile Scrum methodology during the project process. In this way, we were able to control our progress and also exchanged ideas.
- We collected our collaborative notebook works that we created over Google Colab.
- In the project, we used Github, Google Colab and Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Regex, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy.

## My roles in the project:

Here we passed the dataset given to us through the following stages:
* Detection of None data,
* Dropping features with a high percentage of Null Data,
* Data Cleaning
* Handling Missing Value
* Handling Outliers
* Feature Engineering
* Converting categoric features into numbers
* A simple visualization of feats

## Results;
* In this project I realized how difficult it is to get the data into a certain order.
* I learned how to make dirty datasets fit.
